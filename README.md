# rules_license_min

This is a temporary fork of rules_license because I have been having issues with the
  rules_python dependency of rules_license.
I stripped the repo down to the minimum necessary pieces I needed, to try and reduce the
  surface area.

Also, rules_license is still not fully migrated to bzlmod, so that may be part of the issue too.
