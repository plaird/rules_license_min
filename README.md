# rules_license_min

This is a temporary fork of rules_license because I have been having issues with the
  rules_python dependency of rules_license.
I removed the explicit reference to rules_python to try and get through my issues.

Also, rules_license is still not fully migrated to bzlmod, so that may be part of the issue too.
